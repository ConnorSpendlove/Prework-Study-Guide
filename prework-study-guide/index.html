        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of the webpage.</li>
          <li>"HTML" stands for: Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>HTML is composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Elements nested in side of other elements are refered to as "child elements" while the element they are in are refererd to "parent elements."</li>
          <li>Located at the top of the document, the declaration "!DOCTYPE html" tells the browser that the document is written in HTML.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Following this, we see the html tag which represents the start of the HTML document.</li>
            <li>The html tag is used to assign attributes to the website, like the language.</li>
            <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
         </ul>
          <li>The HEAD element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>"Meta", "title", "style", "base", "link", and "script" elements are nested in the head element.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
              <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
              <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
              <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
              <li>The BODY element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
          <li>Closing tags begin with a forward slash.</li>
          <li>"Header", "main", "footer", h#", "p", "ul", "ol", "li", "img", "br", and "a" elements are nested in the body element.</li>
         <ul>
          <li>The header element appears at the top of the page and usually contains a navigation menu and/or introductory content.</li>
          <li>The main element contains the main content of a document.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The img element can contain many attributes;the "src" attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image. While the "alt" attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The a element contains an "href" attribute that  points to the URL for the link.</li>
          </ul>
         </ul>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>The "rel" attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>"CSS" stands for: Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. </li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Style sheets can be embedded directly into the HTML file with an internal CSS style sheet, but is not felxible and is hard to make changes to.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS box model: Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>"*" declares that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>While positioning property, "text-align" is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>Refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #, or with semantic references.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values.</li>
          <li>You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script (top to bottom).</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>However, declaring a function does not mean that the code will automatically execute. We need to call the function in the code</li>
            <li>To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute.spot we want it to execute.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>String: This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li>Number: This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
          <li>Boolean: This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
          <li>Array: This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li>Object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments.</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Addition: Add two numbers together or combine two strings. +</li>
            <li>Subtraction, Multiplication, Division: These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math. -, *, /</li>
            <li>Assignment: This assigns a value to a variable. =</li>
            <li>Strict equality: This performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result. ===</li>
            <li>Not, Does-not-equal: This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal. !, !==</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>Events: These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response.</li>
          <li>Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.</li>
            <li>All types except Object define immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language. We refer to values of these types as primitive values.</li>
            <li>All primitive types, except null, can be tested by the typeof operator.</li>
            <li>All primitive types, except null and undefined, have their corresponding object wrapper types, which provide useful methods for working with the primitive values.</li>
            <li>The Null type is inhabited by exactly one value: null.</li>
            <li>The Undefined type is inhabited by exactly one value: undefined.</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Conceptually, undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object.</li>
          </ul>
            <li>The Boolean type represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false.</li>
            <li>The BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude.</li>
            <li>A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>There are two types of object properties: The data property and the accessor property.</li>
            <li>Each property has corresponding attributes.</li>
            <li>Data properties associate a key with a value. It can be described by the following attributes: </li>
           <ul>
            <li>value: The value retrieved by a get access of the property. Can be any JavaScript value.</li>
            <li>writeable: A boolean value indicating if the property can be changed with an assignment.</li>
            <li>enumerable: A boolean value indicating if the property can be enumerated by a for...in loop.</li>
            <li>configurable: A boolean value indicating if the property can be deleted, can be changed to an accessor property, and can have its attributes changed.</li>
           </ul>
           </ul>
          <li>Accessor property: Associates a key with one of two accessor functions (get and set) to retrieve or store a value.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>An accessor property has the following attributes:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>get: A function called with an empty argument list to retrieve the property value whenever a get access to the value is performed.</li>
              <li>set: A function called with an argument that contains the assigned value. Executed whenever a specified property is attempted to be changed.</li>
              <li>enumerable: A boolean value indicating if the property can be enumerated by a for...in loop.</li>
              <li>configurable: A boolean value indicating if the property can be deleted, can be changed to a data property, and can have its attributes changed.</li>
              <li>Arrays are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the length property.</li>
            </ul>
