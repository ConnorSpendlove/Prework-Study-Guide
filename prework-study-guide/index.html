        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of the webpage.</li>
          <li>"HTML" stands for: Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>HTML is composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Elements nested in side of other elements are refered to as "child elements" while the element they are in are refererd to "parent elements."</li>
          <li>Located at the top of the document, the declaration "!DOCTYPE html" tells the browser that the document is written in HTML.</li>
          <li>Following this, we see the html tag which represents the start of the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The html tag is used to assign attributes to the website, like the language.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>The HEAD element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>"Meta", "title", "style", "base", "link", and "script" elements are nested in the head element.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The BODY element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
          <li>Closing tags begin with a forward slash.</li>
          <li>"Header", "main", "footer", h#", "p", "ul", "ol", "li", "img", "br", and "a" elements are nested in the body element.</li>
          <li>The header element appears at the top of the page and usually contains a navigation menu and/or introductory content.</li>
          <li>The main element contains the main content of a document.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The img element can contain many attributes;the "src" attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image. While the "alt" attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The a element contains an "href" attribute that  points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
